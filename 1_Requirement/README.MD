 * Research
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It assist to improve the whole system of voting and develop user to improve their mindset.

 * Defining System
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Extract year
> Extract branch code 
> Final Candidate file   with no of vote
> Deleate illigle vote 
> Final Winner List 
> Generate new Election

* Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This requires Knowledge of C programming and basic idea to solve the input.

* Cost 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> cost is not required for this project.

* Feature
> Solve the issue which we have facing in offline voting system.
> user can only put one vote and it will be save in our system.

* SWOT Analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>SWOT analysis is a strategic planning and strategic management technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

* Strength
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> USER Interface to make it interesting
> simple and easy to use.

* Weaknesses
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Input not in orderly fashion, and no tracking for the current row and column.
> Output could be overwhelming and will take multiple look to verify results.

* Oppourtunites 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> each user have opportunity to give the vote and every one was get their vote.
> Graphic increase the user interface ability.

* Threats
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Competitors.
> Advancements in technology.
> Functionality is basic and get replaced by better algorithms.

* 4W and 1H
4W- Who, What, When, Where
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Who- This is open for anyone.

> What- it is  better for the now a days for smooth voting system

> When- It is in process to build as a part of LTTS module being descriptive.

> Where- It is made using visual studio code on windows 10.

* 1H- How
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How- It will build using very simple algorithm by taking inputs from user and give a solution for the same.

* Detail Requirements
